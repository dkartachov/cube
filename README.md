Disclaimer: Moved to [Borz](https://github.com/dkartachov/borz). I decided to work on my own orchestrator from scratch because it's more fun that way.

# Cube
This is a simple container orchestrator I am building while following [Tim Boring](https://github.com/timboring)'s book [_Build an Orchestrator in Go (From Scratch)_](https://www.manning.com/books/build-an-orchestrator-in-go-from-scratch?new=true&experiment=B).

## Future plans
The material covered in the book (however **fantastic**) is only enough to build a rudimentary orchestrator. I would like to expand on this orchestrator in the near future by implementing more features and making it more robust. I will consider **this project** complete once I finish covering all the material in the book. I will start a **new project** by cloning this repository. It would be interesting to compare both projects down the line to see how much progress I make - if any. But let's not get ahead of ourselves... 

**I must complete this project first.**
